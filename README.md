# wildshield
a platform for reporting wildlife threats: real-time, community-powered, ai-backed.

---

## why it exists  
response to fires, poaching, and distress is often too slow.  
we built this to bridge the silence between tourists, locals, and NGOs.

---

## what it does  
- maps and monitors incidents: fire, poaching, animal behavior  
- enables real-time reporting anonymous and verified  
- analyzes photos and videos using ai: wildlife, injuries, plant life  
- predicts fire spread using weather data  
- tracks animal movement and disease  
- provides NGOs tools to act faster, smarter

## my part  
i led the design and ui/ux 
from how it moves, to how it feels.  
i shaped the visual language:  
color, motion, layout, flow.  

---

## design in action 
this platform isn’t just built, it’s felt.  
i shaped the experience to speak calm, clarity, and care.
